## Updates to Public Preview IoT Plug and Play Certification 

Thank you for your interest in IoT Plug and Play certification program. 

We are currently pausing our certification process while we update our system to support IoT Plug and Play. Once the update is complete, you will be able to submit your IoT Plug and Play enabled devices.

We are excited to open the new IoT Plug and Play certification process later this summer. With the new certification system, you will be able to publish your device prior to IoT Plug and Play general availability.

We will have new requirements for IoT Plug and Play certification. What it means is there will be new certification requirement, new PnP SDK and new DTDL languages and all the partners existing and new will have to recertify their devices with the new Plug and play certification requirements.

We recommend you [learn more](https://aka.ms/iotblog/IoTPlugandPlay)  about the new Public Preview Refresh for IoT Plug and Play.

Notable changes of the certification portal from Public Preview (available Aug 2019) are:

-   Remove ability to run ‘Connect + test’ to run validation test
-   Remove ability to publish the certified Plug and Play device to the device catalog.

Existing public and company repository will continue to work
