# Certified for Azure IoT program (Legacy devices)

---

## Overview

Prior to the launch of the Azure Certified Device program, hardware partners could previously certify their products under the Certified for Azure IoT program. This program, like the Azure Certified Device certifications, validated device capabilities with Azure IoT Hub, Azure IoT Edge, and IoT Plug and Play. The Azure Certified Device experience builds on the Certified for Azure IoT program with updated certification qualifications and an improved device submission experience for partners.
 
**Devices that have been previously certified under the Certified for Azure IoT program as an ‘IoT Hub certified device’ will continue to appear on the Azure Certified Device catalog as a ‘Legacy device.’** This label indicates that devices have previously qualified for certification through the now-retired program, but have not completed certification through the updated Azure Certified Device program.

## FAQs

**Q. How can I tell if a device on the catalog is a legacy device?**

Legacy devices will not have a blue outline or label `Azure Certified Device.` You can also use the filters to curate your view to include legacy devices.

**Q. I previously certified a device under the old program but want to get my product re-certified for the Azure Certified Device program. How should I go about this?**
