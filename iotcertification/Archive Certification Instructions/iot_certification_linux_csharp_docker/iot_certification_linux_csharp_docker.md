# Step 1: Sign Up To Azure IoT Hub

[Sign up](https://account.windowsazure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0044p) to the Azure IoT Hub service and follow the instructions mentioned [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-csharp-csharp-getstarted#create-an-iot-hub). Refer to [this documentation](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/iotdev/understand-different-connection-strings-in-azure-iot-hub/) on how to find the connection string for your IoT Hub.

-   **IoT Hub Connection String**: An example of IoT Hub Connection String is as below:

         HostName=[YourIoTHubName];SharedAccessKeyName=[YourAccessKeyName];SharedAccessKey=[YourAccessKey]

<a name="Step-2-Register"></a>
# Step 2: Register Device

In this section, you will register your device using DeviceExplorer. The DeviceExplorer is a Windows application that interfaces with Azure IoT Hub and can perform the following operations:

-   Device management
    -   Create new devices
    -   List existing devices and expose device properties stored on Device Hub
    -   Provides ability to update device keys
    -   Provides ability to delete a device
-   Monitoring events from your device
-   Sending messages to your device

To run DeviceExplorer tool, use following configuration string as described in
[Step1](#Step-1-Configure):

-   IoT Hub Connection String

**Steps:**
1.  Click [here](<https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md>) to download and install DeviceExplorer.

2.  Add connection information under the Configuration tab and click the **Update** button.

3.  Create and register the device with your IoT Hub using instructions as below.

    a. Click the **Management** tab.

    b. Your registered devices will be displayed in the list. In case your device is not there in the list, click **Refresh** button. If this is your first time, then you shouldn't retrieve anything.

    c. Click **Create** button to create a device ID and key.

    d. Once created successfully, device will be listed in DeviceExplorer.

    e. Right click the device and from context menu select "**Copy connection
    string for selected device**".

    f. Save this information in Notepad. You will need this information in
    later steps.

***Not running Windows on your PC?*** - Please follow the instructions [here](<https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/manage_iot_hub.md>) to provision your device and get its credentials.

# Step 3: Build a Linux Docker image that includes the .NET Core runtime and the sample used for validating your device.

This sections walks you through building a Linux Docker image and running the image to validate the IoT Client SDK on your ARM 32 device.  Unless specified otherwise, the Docker image will contain all necessary prerequisites for running the sample tests required for IoT certification on your device.

<a name="Step_3_1:_Development"></a>
## 3.1 Prepare your development environment

- Install the latest .NET Core from https://dot.net
- Install .NET Framework 4.7 Developer Pack: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3186612/the-net-framework-4-7-developer-pack-and-language-packs
- Install .NET Framework 4.5.1 Developer Pack: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40772

<a name="Step_3_2:_Build"></a>
## 3.2 Build and push the Docker image to your registry

Using [this Dockerfile](./Dockerfile), build a Docker image that is based on the [.NET Core Arm32 Linux image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-samples/):

-   In your development environment, open the directory containing [azure-iot-sdk-csharp](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-samples-csharp); specifically, open the following directory:

        iot-hub\Samples\device\MessageSample

-   Copy and paste [this Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) to the MessageSample directory shown above.
-   Add the IoT Hub device connection string as an environment variable within the Dockerfile.  Specifically, open the Dockerfile and replace '<your_device_connection_string>' with your device connection string and save your changes.
-   Using Docker and the Dockerfile, build a Docker image that containerizes the .NET Core Message Sample app.  Next, push this image to your Docker registry.  For example:

        cd iot-hub\Samples\device\MessageSample
        docker build -t <your_docker_account>/<your_docker_repo>:<your_img_tag> .
        docker push <your_docker_account>/<your_docker_repo>:<your_img_tag>

The sample contains two types of tests - one for sending messages to IoT Hub and another for receiving messages from IoT Hub. Both tests support different protocols. You can modify the tests to use your choice of protocol before building the Docker image. By default the tests will build using the AMQP protocol.

To run different protocols:

-   In your development environment, open the following file in notepad:

        iot-hub\Samples\device\MessageSample\Program.cs

-   Scroll down to the section of code containing the protocol information.

-   Find the below code:

        private static TransportType s_transportType = TransportType.Amqp;

    The default protocol used is AMQP. Code for other protocols(HTTP/MQTT) are mentioned just below the above line in the script. Comment/Uncomment the line as per the protocol you want to use and save your changes.

-   Rebuild the Docker image using the steps described at the beginning of Step 3.2.

<a name="Step_3_3:_Run"></a>
## 3.3 Run and validate the sample

In this section you will run the sample to validate the communication between your device and Azure IoT Hub. You will send the messages to the Azure IoT Hub service and validate that IoT Hub has successfully receive the data. You will also monitor any messages sent from the Azure IoT Hub to client.

***Note:*** *Take screenshots of all the operations you will perform in this
section. These will be needed in [Step 4](#Step_4_2:_Share).*

### 3.3.1 Send Device Events to IoT Hub

1.  Launch the DeviceExplorer as explained in [Step 2](#Step_2:_Register) and navigate to **Data** tab. Select the device name you created from the drop-down list of device IDs and click **Monitor** button.

    ![DeviceExplorer\_Monitor](images/3_3_1_01.png)

2.  DeviceExplorer is now monitoring data sent from the selected device to the IoT Hub.

3.  Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device, run the sample by pulling and running the Docker image.  For example:
		
        docker run --rm <your_docker_account>/<your_docker_repo>:<your_img_tag>
    
4. You should be able to see the events received in device console on successful execution.

	**If HTTP protocol:**

	![DeviceExplorer\_Notification\_Send](images/terminal_message_send_from_device_http.png)

	**If MQTT protocol:**

	![DeviceExplorer\_Notification\_Send](images/terminal_message_send_from_device_mqtt.png)

	**If AMQP protocol:**

	![DeviceExplorer\_Notification\_Send](images/terminal_message_send_from_device_amqp.png)

5. You should be able to see the events received in the DeviceExplorer's data tab.

	**If HTTP protocol:**	

     ![DeviceExplorer\_Notification\_Send](images/device_message_send_from_device_http.png)

	**If MQTT protocol:**

	 ![DeviceExplorer\_Notification\_Send](images/device_message_send_from_device_mqtt.png)

	**If AMQP protocol:**
	
	 ![DeviceExplorer\_Notification\_Send](images/device_message_send_from_device_amqp.png)

### 3.3.2 Receive messages from IoT Hub

1.  To verify that you can send messages from the IoT Hub to your device, go to the **Messages to Device** tab in DeviceExplorer.  Note that you will need to run the sample ap again on your device using the same command as in the previous step, such as:
        docker run --rm <your_docker_account>/<your_docker_repo>:<your_img_tag>

2.  Select the device you created using Device ID drop down.

3.  Add some text to the Message field, then click Send.

   	![DeviceExplorer\_Notification\_Send](images/terminal_message_receive_from_device_http.png)
